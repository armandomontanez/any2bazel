"""Flag canonicalization -- the core IP of the diff engine.

Raw compile commands never diff cleanly: absolute vs relative paths, flag
ordering, sandbox include prefixes, toolchain-default flags Bazel injects that
CMake never had. This module normalizes a raw flag list into the canonical
form the model stores, applying a per-flag POLICY:

  * defines  (-D)        : order-insensitive  -> sorted, deduped
  * includes (-I/-isystem/-iquote): ORDER MATTERS (search order) -> preserved,
                            paths made repo-relative
  * other flags          : split into "correctness" vs "ignorable"

The asymmetry (require CMake flags present in Bazel; tolerate extra Bazel
flags) is enforced in diff.py, not here. Here we only normalize and classify.

#   1. Prefix greediness: stripping "-fstack-protector" also eats a project's
#      "-fstack-protector-strong", so a flag CMake and Bazel BOTH set no longer
#      cancels and fabricates a false cmake-only discrepancy.
#   2. Asymmetry direction: stripping a flag only from the Bazel side can only
#      ever CREATE false cmake-only errors (it shrinks the Bazel set), never
#      hide a real one.
# Instead they are kept through canonicalization so shared flags cancel in the
# subtraction, and filtered only from the cosmetic `bazel_only` DISPLAY in
# diff.py (they land in the tolerated bazel-only bucket regardless). If CMake
# sets a variant Bazel lacks (e.g. CMake -fstack-protector-strong, Bazel only
