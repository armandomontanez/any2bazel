"""Asymmetric parity diff: CMake reference model (A) vs Bazel model (B).

Produces a worklist of discrepancies for the fix loop. Each iteration of the
migrate loop calls this; an empty worklist (for a full round) means "done".
Parity has two stages, both reported here:
  COMPILE PARITY    -- per-TU flag/define/include equivalence (project-wide
                       TU-set) + external link-dependency closure.
  LINK CONSISTENCY  -- per name-aligned executable/shared-lib, equivalent link
                       flags (link_flags_diff).

ASYMMETRY: a flag present in CMake but missing in Bazel is a discrepancy
(under-specified Bazel target -> likely wrong build). A flag present only in
Bazel is tolerated (toolchain defaults already stripped in canonicalize). The
one exception is defines, where an EXTRA Bazel define can change behavior, so
extra defines are reported at lower severity.

    """Apply the COMPILE-PARITY stage to TEST targets. Two checks:

      1. TU-SET union of all test sources (like libraries): same test .cc files
         compiled with equivalent flags, regardless of how they're grouped into
         test binaries or named. Presence is judged against ALL sources on the
         other side (a_all/b_all), not just its test union: a test source on one
         side may be compiled into a (testonly) library on the other -- a
         grouping difference, not a missing source. Only "compiled nowhere" is
         flagged.
      2. Test-binary EXISTENCE by count: a coarse check that both sides produce
         a comparable number of test executables, catching the case where test
         sources compile but are never linked into runnable tests.

    SCOPE: tests get the COMPILE-PARITY stage only. LINK CONSISTENCY (per-binary
    link flags and link-dep closure) runs for PRODUCTION executables/shared
    libs, not for test binaries: tests align by source-set union, not by binary
    identity, so there's no per-binary link command to compare. So with tests
    on, "converged" means production artifacts are link-consistent AND all test
    SOURCES compile equivalently -- not that each test binary links identically.
    Extending link consistency to per-test-binary is a natural future increment.
