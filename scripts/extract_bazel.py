"""Extract a CanonicalModel from `bazel aquery --output=jsonproto`.

aquery is the Bazel-side counterpart to the CMake File API: it exposes the
actual actions the build would run -- CppCompile/ObjcCompile actions (one per
TU, with the full argv) AND CppLink/CppArchive actions (the link closure).
compile commands alone would miss the link half, so we use aquery. ObjcCompile
is Bazel's mnemonic for .m/.mm sources compiled via objc_library -- CMake's
File API has no such distinction (it reports those under CppCompile too), so
both must map to the same neutral compile bucket here or objc_library sources
silently vanish from the Bazel model.

Usage:
    bazel aquery 'mnemonic("CppCompile|ObjcCompile|CppLink|CppArchive", //...)' \
        --output=jsonproto > aquery.json
    python3 extract_bazel.py aquery.json <repo_root> model.bazel.json

The jsonproto shape (ActionGraphContainer):
    { "artifacts": [{id, pathFragmentId}], "actions": [{mnemonic, arguments[],
      targetId, outputIds[]}], "targets": [{id, label}], "pathFragments": [...] }
We reconstruct artifact paths from pathFragments, map actions -> targets, and
store each action's RAW ARGV as an Action. Interpretation (argv -> TUs / link
flags / inferred deps) is the differ's job (reconstruct.py); the extractor only
records the faithful action graph plus the kind/role annotations it can resolve.

    Bazel aquery represents an action's input closure as a DAG of depSets

    actions. Two properties of that DAG make the obvious implementation
    unusable, and both were learned the hard way on cloudflare/workerd, whose
    //src/... graph has 722 C++ actions over 2052 depSets:

    * **It is a DAG, not a tree.** A depSet reachable by k distinct paths gets
      visited k times, so concatenating child results counts *paths*, not
      *nodes*. On workerd (2052 depSets) that reached 349M artifact IDs and
      2.7GB RSS before the OOM killer; the deduplicated closure of the whole
      graph is 5.6M IDs, and the largest single closure is 13k.
    * **Only a couple of actions ever need it.** Just the TS path consumes
      input closures. Eagerly indexing all depSets did the work for every one
      of them (all of it discarded on a project with no TS actions at all).

    So: walk the DAG on demand with a visited set (linear in nodes+edges, no
    revisits), and don't memoize whole closures -- the overlap between closures
    is exactly what made materializing them expensive. `resolve()` is called
    once per consuming action, which is a handful of times per build.
