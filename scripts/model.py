"""Canonical build model — an ACTION-based IR shared by all extractors.

Each build system extracts into THIS model. The model is a faithful, dumb record
of build ACTIONS; it does NOT canonicalize. All interpretation (parsing argv into
translation units / link flags, stripping build-system noise, grouping per
language) happens in the DIFFER (see reconstruct.py + diff.py). This keeps the
model language- and build-system-neutral: the neutral floor of an action is its
raw argv (a list of strings), which every build system can produce -- Bazel
aquery emits it natively; CMake and Maven synthesize it from structured config.

Design decisions baked in here:
  * The neutral floor is RAW ARGV. Structured semantics (a target's deps, an
    action's inputs/outputs) are RESOLVED ANNOTATIONS a frontend fills when it
    knows them, and the differ infers from argv when it doesn't. This is the
    `resolved | raw | unknown` idea: argv is the raw floor (always present),
    annotations are the resolved overlay (when known). Never lossy.
  * Canonicalization is NOT here -- it is in the differ, keyed on the model's
    `build_system` tag (for noise) and each action's mnemonic (for grouping).
  * Dependency is an ABSTRACT identity (a name), not a resolved path/label.
