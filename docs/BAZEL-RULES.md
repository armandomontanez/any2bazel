# Bazel rules and versions: what we have actually used

Notes for the Bazel *target* side of a migration — which rulesets have been
exercised by the migrations in [EXPERIMENTS.md](../EXPERIMENTS.md), at which
versions, and the decisions behind reaching for a ruleset or writing rules by
hand. Nothing here is a recommendation in the abstract: read the "how far it was
exercised" column, because that is the whole content.

This file will degrade. Version ranges age, rulesets change hands, and the
entries below are dated by construction. Prefer re-checking over trusting it —
and see [Versions are resolved, not remembered](#versions-are-resolved-not-remembered),
which is the one rule here that does not age.

Last checked: the ranges below reflect the migrations as of this file's commit.

## Versions are resolved, not remembered

Two failure modes, both observed:

**An agent writes the version that was current when it was trained.** This
repo's Dolphin migration declared `rules_cc 0.0.17` and `platforms 0.0.10`. At
the time of writing, `rules_cc` was at 0.2.22 — 49 releases later. Nothing
failed, so nothing surfaced it. Resolve the version at migration time from the
registry (`https://bcr.bazel.build/modules/<name>/metadata.json` lists every
published version) or from the ruleset's tags, and never from recall.

**The version you declare is not the version you get.** MVS treats it as a
*floor*, and the binding floor is usually `bazel_tools` — built into Bazel
itself, so `.bazelversion` is part of the dependency specification. Same
one-line `MODULE.bazel` declaring `rules_cc 0.0.16`, three Bazel versions:

| Bazel | resolved `rules_cc` |
|---|---|
| 7.5.0 | 0.0.16 |
| 8.4.2 | **0.1.1** |
| 9.2.0 | **0.2.17** |

On 9.2.0 anything below 0.2.17 is inert. So record what resolved, alongside the
Bazel version (`bazel mod graph`; add `--include_builtin` to see `bazel_tools`),
and put `common --check_direct_dependencies=error` in `.bazelrc` so a stale
declared version fails the build instead of warning. Dolphin's `MODULE.bazel`
fails that check today. This bites version *upgrades* hardest: bumping Bazel
moves rulesets with no change to `MODULE.bazel`.

The same command shows the transitive cost. Dolphin declares **two** modules and
resolves **27**, including `rules_kotlin`, `rules_android`, `rules_swift` and
`rules_jvm_external` — in a C++ emulator, arriving via
`rules_cc → protobuf → …`. Worth knowing before it is a surprise.

Newest is not automatically right, either. The three Google C++ projects whose
existing Bazel builds we diffed against were all *behind* the latest `rules_cc`
when checked (0.2.14, 0.2.18, 0.2.19 vs. 0.2.22 published). What comparable
projects actually ship is usually a better signal than what the registry offers.

## Exercised by these migrations

Ranges, not recommendations. "Declared" is what a `MODULE.bazel` asked for;
"resolved" is what MVS produced and therefore what actually ran.

| ruleset | declared range | resolved | migrations | how far it was exercised |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rules_cc` | 0.0.16 – 0.2.22 | 0.2.14 – 0.2.22 | Dolphin; fmt, spdlog, TinyXML2, zlib; BoringSSL, Abseil, RE2; PowerToys | Dolphin: `//...` green in 3 configurations, 1350 tests pass, action-graph parity 0 errors. PowerToys: `--config=windows` native MSVC or `hermetic-llvm` cross-compilation. Build re-verified green at declared 0.0.16 / 0.1.1 / 0.2.22; `compatibility_level = 1` and both `//cc:defs.bzl` and the per-rule `.bzl` files exist across that whole span |
| `platforms` | 0.0.10 – 1.1.0 | 1.0.0 – 1.1.0 | same | as above; only ever a transitive/constraint dep |
| `rules_jvm_external` | 6.7 | — | Guava (Maven frontend) | one point, coordinate deps only; the Maven frontend is argv-floor, so this is not a parity claim |
| `rules_dotnet` | — | — | PowerToys | C# source compilation parity (via MSBuild extraction, planned) |
| `rules_license`, `googletest`, `google_benchmark`, `rules_python` | see note | — | BoringSSL, Abseil, RE2 | **not our choices** — these are what those projects' *own* Bazel builds declare (`rules_license` 1.0.0, `googletest` 1.17.0.bcr.2, `google_benchmark` 1.9.4/1.9.5, `rules_python` 1.7.0). We diffed against them; we did not select them |

Bazel itself: **7.5.0** (VSCode, pinned in `.bazelversion`) and **9.2.0**
(Dolphin). No migration here has needed a Bazel-version-specific workaround.
Every "resolved" column above is a fact about 9.2.0, not about the declared file.

## Written by hand instead of adopting a ruleset

The interesting cases. Both are C++/TS migrations where an obvious ecosystem
ruleset existed and was not used — with the reasoning, and the caveat that
neither was A/B tested.

### VSCode: `rules_ts` / `rules_esbuild` / `rules_nodejs` → 4 custom rules

The build is gulp + gulp-tsb + esbuild plugins; the Bazel side is `ts_program`,
`esbuild_bundle`, `vscode_app`, `nodegyp_module` (~500 lines of Starlark, ~1000
lines of Node wrappers), and a `MODULE.bazel` whose only external deps are two
`http_archive`s for Electron and Electron's node headers.

The deciding reason is **what kind of equivalence the migration is for**:

> `rules_ts` and `rules_esbuild` are designed for **content-equivalent** output —
> idiomatic settings, sensible defaults. This migration needed **byte-identical**
> output to what gulp-tsb + esbuild produce (banner, `sourceMappingURL` comment,
> contents-mapper and external-override plugins, `absWorkingDir`, TS boilerplate
> stripping). Fighting the rules to reproduce npm's exact bytes was going to be
> harder than owning the Starlark.

Four supporting reasons:

* **Every stage needed pre/post processing regardless.** `ts_program` runs tsc
  *plus* a non-TS asset copy *plus* the NLS transform; `esbuild_bundle` injects
  two plugins and post-processes the `.js` for path normalization and the
  sourcemap comment. Layered on `rules_ts` these become extra rules consuming and
  rewriting its outputs — a longer pipeline for the same result.
* **The project shape doesn't benefit.** `ts_project` is built around
  per-tsconfig granularity and project references; vscode is one monolithic
  ~7000-file program with no project refs, so the ruleset would have been used as
  a single opaque wrapper anyway.
* **Iteration speed on byte parity.** Chasing `__toESM(x, 1)` vs `__toESM(x)`
  was a one-line `preserveSymlinks` toggle plus a regex in the same file; a wrong
  `absWorkingDir` was one attribute. Through a ruleset those are config wrestling.
* **Dependency graph stays at two.** `rules_ts` + `rules_nodejs` would pull
  `aspect_bazel_lib`, `rules_js`, a pnpm-based npm toolchain, etc.

There is also a hard structural conflict, verified by reading
`rules_ts` 3.9.2 rather than assuming it. `ts_project` *does* expose
`source_map` / `out_dir` / `root_dir` attributes — but its validator
(`ts_project_options_validator.cjs`) **fails the build when an attribute
disagrees with the tsconfig on disk**, and separately rejects an `outDir` that
resolves above the package (*"not supported by ts_project because all output
files must be within the package output directory"*). vscode's build sets
`sourceMap: false, outDir: "../out/vs"` in `src/tsconfig.json` and then
*overrides* them programmatically at build time in `build/lib/compilation.ts`
(`options.sourceMap = true`, plus `rootDir`, `baseUrl`, `sourceRoot`, and a
`newLine` computed by reading `compilation.ts`'s own bytes). So the ruleset's
premise — the tsconfig is the source of truth and the BUILD file mirrors it — is
the opposite of this build's premise. Adopting it would mean editing the tsconfig,
which changes the reference build you are trying to match.

**The generalization**: an off-the-shelf rule encodes a premise about *where
configuration lives*. Ecosystem rules are mostly written for greenfield projects
where the checked-in config is canonical. A migration that must match an existing
build can only adopt such a rule if it shares that premise.

**What was given up:** per-file `ts_project` caching (the custom rule emits one
`declare_directory`), `rules_esbuild`'s runfiles integration (node_modules is
staged by hand), and community fixes for edge cases not yet hit.

**Caveat, stated because it matters:** this was not A/B tested. The choice was
made from "we know we need many hooks, and parity means unusual output" — both
of which held — but nobody can say `rules_ts` would have cost N more days. **If
parity is not required** and content-equivalent idiomatic output is acceptable,
`rules_ts` is probably the right call.

### Dolphin: Qt handled by hand, and a ruleset that was missed

Dolphin's Qt support is a repository rule (`third_party/qt/qt_detect.bzl`) that
discovers the host's Qt include roots, versioned private-header directory and
`moc` binary, plus a `dolphin_moc` macro wrapping moc in a genrule. No Qt ruleset
was considered — which was an oversight, not a decision.

Two Qt rulesets exist, and **the name in the registry is the one that fits a
CMake migration least**:

| | `Vertexwahn/rules_qt6` | `kklochkov/rules_qt` |
|---|---|---|
| in the BCR as `rules_qt` | **yes** — 0.0.7, 4 releases | **no** |
| own latest version | 0.0.7 | **2.0.1** |
| where Qt comes from | downloads a prebuilt Qt; README: *"only version 6.8.3 is tested and supported"* | `qt.local_repo(path=…)` runs **qmake** to discover the installation, or `remote_repo` |
| codegen | moc via genrule | moc / uic / rcc / qml as rules with providers |

CMake resolves Qt with `find_package(Qt6 …)`, i.e. against the *host*. So the
fitting choice is `qt_local_repo`, which asks qmake the same question — and that
is in the ruleset that is **not** in the BCR under `rules_qt`. Querying the
registry for `rules_qt` returns the prebuilt-single-version one, which would have
pinned Qt 6.8.3 and turned the migration into a different build.

Neither has been used here, so this is a pointer for whoever hits Qt next, not a
recommendation. The transferable parts:

* **BCR presence is not fitness, and BCR absence is not nonexistence.** The
  registry is a distribution channel, not a curated index. Search wider, and
  expect more than one ruleset per domain.
* **The fitness test is the migration's own test:** does the ruleset resolve the
  dependency the way the reference build does? A ruleset that downloads a pinned
  SDK where the original build queried the host is a *scope change* — sometimes
  an improvement, but it must be a stated decision, because it will move the
  parity diff for reasons that are not bugs.

## `rules_foreign_cc`: not for the code under migration

It runs the original build system (CMake, make, autotools) inside a Bazel action.
That produces artifacts, but the compile and link actions happen inside an opaque
wrapper, so `bazel aquery` cannot see them — and the action-graph diff this whole
method rests on has nothing to compare. Adopting it for the subject of the
migration removes the only signal that the migration is faithful.

The boundary is worth stating precisely: the objection is to losing the action
graph **for code you are migrating**. Driving a foreign build for a leaf
prebuilt artifact you never claimed parity on is a different thing — VSCode's
`nodegyp_module` shells out to `node-gyp rebuild` for native `.node` modules, and
nothing is lost, because those binaries were never part of the parity claim.

## Checklist for the Bazel side of a migration

1. Resolve every version at migration time; do not write one from memory.
2. Prefer what comparable projects ship over what the registry says is newest.
3. Search beyond the BCR, and expect several rulesets per domain.
4. For each candidate ruleset, ask whether it shares the reference build's premise
   about where configuration lives, and whether it resolves dependencies the same
   way (host vs. pinned download).
5. Decide what equivalence you need — byte-identical or content-equivalent —
   before choosing. Ecosystem rules target the latter.
6. Weigh the transitive graph (`bazel mod graph`), not just the direct dep.
7. Keep `rules_foreign_cc` away from the code under migration.
8. When the migration converges, run `bazel mod graph` and record the **resolved**
   versions. That is the only version list worth keeping.
